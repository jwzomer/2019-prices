					<h1>At the Water's Edge: <span class="subtitle">Managing Our Land and Water in a Changing Landscape</span></h1>
					<p>
						Mark your calendar for the 2019 Natural Areas Conference (NAC), which will be hosted by the Natural Areas Association (NAA) and held at the Pittsburgh Sheraton, right on the waterfront at the place where the three rivers of Pittsburgh - the Monongahela, the Allegheny, and the Ohio - come together. The views are spectacular, and scores of diverse natural areas are only a short drive away. This event will focus on providing access to cutting-edge information, emerging management techniques, and science-based practices for natural areas practitioners. Click here to access the scholarship application for practitioners working in PA and the Pittsburgh area. This scholarship will cover all or part of a regional practitioner's registration costs.
					</p>
					<p>
						The NAA is the only national, nonprofit membership organization dedicated to the support and advancement of the community of natural areas practitioners. We provide them with the best scientific information to inform their work on the ground. Now in its 46th year, the annual NAC is one of the nation's oldest continuous gatherings of conservation professionals. Here they learn about new research, receive valuable training and make important connections with other professionals in conservation-related fields.

					<h2>Events at a Glance</h2>
					<h3>Beanblossom Bottoms Boardwalk: Successes And Challenges Of A Wetland Preserve And Public Access Site - Beanblossom Bottoms Nature Preserve</h3>
					<p>
						Tour the recently renovated 1.5-mile boardwalk at Sycamore Land Trust's 700-acre Beanblossom Bottoms Nature Preserve, and discuss the successes and challenges of creating and maintaining this unique public access and educational feature along with the collaborative efforts to protect and restore the important wetland preserve where it is located.
					</p>
					<h3>Collaborative Conservation In Practice: The Hills Of Gold - Laura Hare Preserve, Bob's Woods And Glacier's End Nature Preserve</h3>
					<p>
						We will explore two state dedicated nature preserves and a conservation easement to look at current and planned restoration activities that are funded through private and federal sources, including invasive species control, controlled burning, white-tailed deer management, restoring an agricultural field to hardwood forest, pollinator habitat and oak establishment in low-quality forest. 
					</p>
					<h3>Indiana Karst Landforms And Their Communities: Sinkholes, Caves And Springs</h3>
					<p>
						This field workshop will familiarize participants with prominent Indiana karst landforms and their communities: sinkholes, caves, and springs. The trip will include a short walk through old growth forest to discuss sinkholes as a unique ecotone, a boat trip to Upper Twin Cave, and a walk to Bronson Cave entrance. Both quantitative and qualitative methods for characterizing the fauna of these habitats will be demonstrated with opportunities for hands-on application. Cave trips will include overviews of cave communities, aquatic fauna censusing (macro-invertebrate and cavefish), as well as exotics control in karst environments.

					<h2>Plenary Sessions</h2>
					<h3>
						Long-Term And Landscape-Level Effects Of Forest Management: The Hardwood Ecosystem Experiment
					</h3>
					<p>
						Participants in the Hardwood Excosystem Experiment (HEE) Field Workshop will have an opportunity to visit HEE Research areas and learn about long-term research related to the management of oak-hickory forests in Indiana. Participants will be able to interact with HEE Researchers and hear about their work studying the effects of different forest management methods on a variety of plant and animal species and how their findings can be applied to the management of Natural Areas.
					</p>
					<h3>Scout Ridge Nature Preserve - Morgan - Monroe State Forest In Monroe County</h3>
					<p>
						Indiana's second dedicated state nature preserve, Scout Ridge contains high quality mesic and dry-mesic upland forest with a diverse understory including a range of ferns.

					<h2>Networking</h2>
					<p>
						The Natural Areas Conference is designed to be a place where the natural areas professional community can come together to exchange ideas - but it's also intended to be a place where attendees can strengthen relationships with colleagues; younger members can benefit from the experiences of more established professionals; and everyone can help to build a stronger community. The conference features several networking events.
					</p>
					<h3>Student-Mentor Networking Lunch</h3>
					<p>
						All students and mentors must indicate their interest during registration, but the buffet lunch is free to all who sign up to participate. Students have an opportunity to interact with those with more experience as natural areas practitioners, and receive on-the-spot advice about their career and professional questions. 
					</p>
					<h3>Poster Session and Reception</h3>
					<p>
						One of the biggest evening gatherings of the Conference. All those who are presenting posters are available to discuss their work with attendees and answer questions. Usually the majority of conferencegoers attend. There will be a cash bar and appetizers. Open to all registrants.
					</p>
					<h3>NAA Awards Dinner</h3>
					<p>
						The high point of our week. At this event we recognize the winners of our NAA Fell and Becker Awards, acknowledge students who have won competition prizes, and present info on the upcoming conference. There will be a cash bar and a buffet-style meal is served. The price of the Awards Dinner is included in a full registration, but pre-registration required.
					</p>
					<h3>NAA Members Meeting and Lunch</h3>
					<p>
						If youâ€™re a member, youâ€™ll have a chance to participate in organizational votes, hear about the direction of the organization, and socialize with other members. Non-members are also welcomeâ€”itâ€™s a great opportunity to learn more about the Natural Areas Association. No cost to registrants, but pre-registration required.
